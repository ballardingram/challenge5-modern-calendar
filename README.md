# Challenge 5 - Work Scheduler
This website was built to showcase my Javascript and 3rd Party API skills by building a work scheduler. The site should have the ability to accept text inputs, indicate past, present, and future time, and save text entries. It will be submitted as a part of Challenge 5 for my UT Full Stack Bootcamp.

## Built With
This website was built with the standard structure of HTML, CSS, and JS files all referenced appropriately. I pulled from JQUERY, Google Fonts, and Fawesome for the icons. I used VS Code to write and edit the code. I used the DOM and Chrome's Dev Tools to make functional and style changes that would improve the User Experience. The style was intentionally changed to something minimalistic.

## Website
You can find the final product at: https://ballardingram.github.io/challenge5-modern-calendar/

## Contributions
This was largely and independent project. I worked with my TA Ian Sears during office hours for a "nudge" in the right direction regarding the text boxes.

## Observations
This is a project I plan on coming back to at some point, because of the math, timing, and event structure. Having the starter code was a big help, but once I started adjusting style and elements in JS I had to watch how it effected everything.

## Challenges
The JS continues to be a challenge and takes up most of the project. I'm working on trying to find set code for certain tasks. Example: Create a timer, what should that code be? or Create a text box you can save text in, what should that code be?
